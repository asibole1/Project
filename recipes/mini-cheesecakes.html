            Okay, I don't know about you but I <em>LOVE</em> cheesecake.
            However, I feel like every time I get a slice, I just can't finish
            it. So, as I expand in my baking abilities, I thought, "I wonder if
            I can make tiny cheesecakes." Sure enough, that is a thing that
            exists! I adapted a recipe from
            <a
              href="https://www.livewellbakeoften.com/mini-cheesecakes/?fbclid=IwAR1vb12hiI3k_95I-TJxTUXrrHAMkYzwtb649GLdoyTMPDMvzimGwRRfwN8"
              >Live Well Bake Often</a

            into a mini muffin pan to make them EXTRA tiny. This version is
            bite-sized, adorable, and delicious. Plus it's super easy to make!
            Enjoy!

            <h3>For the Sauce:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>1 cup fresh or frozen fruit of your choice</li>
              <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
              <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees.</li>
              <li>
                Blend or crush graham crackers into a powder and add butter and
                sugar until moistened.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add the graham cracker mixture to the bottom of a mini cupcake
                pan, lined with cupcake liners. It should be about 1/2 cm thick.
              </li>
              <li>Bake the crusts for 5 minutes.</li>
              <li>
                In a bowl and hand mixer (or stand mixer), combine cream cheese
                and sour cream until smooth. Add usgar and vanilla extract and
                mix till fully combined.
              </li>
              <li>Mix in the egg on low speed until just combined.</li>
              <li>
                Evenly distribute the batter into the liners filled all the way
                to the top.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bake for 20 minutes or until the tops of the cheesecakes are
                set.
              </li>
              <li>Remove from the oven and cool for 1 hour.</li>
              <li>
                Remove the liners from the pan and chill overnight in an
                airtight container.
              </li>
              <li>
                As the cheesecakes are chilling, put your fruit in a small sauce
                pot on medium-low heat. Squeeze 1/2 lemon into the pan and add
                sugar.
              </li>
              <li>
                Put a lid on the pot and let the fruit warm up. When you start
                to see condensation on the lid, open the lid and mash the fruit
                with a potato masher until it's at your desired smoothness (I
                like some fruit chunks in it myself!).
              </li>
              <li>
                Let the mixture simmer about 10-15 minutes or until it reaches
                desired thickness.
              </li>
              <li>
                When ready to eat, remove the cupcake liner and spoon a small
                amount of sauce on top.
              </li>
              <li>Enjoy! ðŸ˜‹</li>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you just can't wait to eat them, you can enjoy them at room
                temp - but it will be better chilled, trust me!
              </li>
              <li>
                If you are impatient and don't get the ingredients out in time,
                you can microwave the cream cheese and the sour cream for 15
                seconds to soften them.
              </li>
              <li>
                It's okay if the tops crack in the oven, it just means that you
                might've overmixed the batter. It'll still taste delicious!
              </li>
              <li>Frozen berries work just as well as fresh for the jam!</li>
              <li>
                To make chocolate cheesecakes, you can add a little extra sugar
                and some baking cocoa to the batter.
              </li>
              <li>This goes great with homemade whipped cream!</li>
              <li>
                I don't take them out of the wrappers to store them so that they
                don't stick together.
              </li>

                WARNING: Be careful, these are super addictive and you'll eat
                them like chips if you don't restrain yourself.
